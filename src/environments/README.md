This Angular project manages environment configurations through specific files located in the environments folder. The folder contains environment.ts along with other files like environment.prod.ts, environment.dev.ts, environment.web.ts, and environment.web.prod.ts, each tailored for different deployment settings such as development, production, and web-specific builds. It's important to note that within the source code, you must only import from environment.ts. This is the default environment file, which the Angular CLI will automatically replace with the corresponding environment file during the build or serve process, based on the fileReplacements configuration in angular.json.

Therefore, there is no need to manually change your imports to match different environment files. Your application's import statement should always refer to environment.ts, and the Angular CLI will take care of the rest, ensuring that the correct set of variables is used for each environment.
